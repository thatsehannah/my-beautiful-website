I am following along a JavaScript Mastery tutorial on YouTube that is helping me learn how to practically use GSAP. The tutorial is using React, but I'm using Nextjs for this project because I would like to practice using this framework with Nextjs so I can comfortable for future projects. I'm also using Tailwind CSS v4 (tutorial uses an older version) so there are different configurations I'm getting used to as well.
